# CimpleCompiler

### What is this?
CimpleCompiler is a lightweight compiler project, co-developed by me and [@ChrisPrg](https://github.com/ChrisPergaminelis), 
for a language that shares similarities with both the widely used C programming language and Pascal. 
This project encompasses a lexical analyzer, a syntax analyzer, a symbol table, and generates functional RISC-V assembly as its final output.

### Why?
This project was developed as part of the Compilers class during the 8th semester of our
Computer Engineering and Computer Science program at the University of Ioannina.
